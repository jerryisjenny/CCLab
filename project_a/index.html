                <p>Jenny Tan, 10/25/1780</p>

                <p>It has no family, or rather, the entire family consists only of itself.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>factories, power plants, and automated production facilities</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>The creature stands tall with a smooth, metallic stem that has a soft sheen. At the top, it blooms
                    with a soft flower that appear to glow faintly, each petal crafted with precision, reflecting light
                    in a soothing way. The flower exude an ethereal quality, its edges rounded and inviting, creating a
                    stark contrast to their industrial roots. When the fruit forms, it resembles a soft, spherical orb,
                    its surface dimpled like a soft sponge. </p>

                It is a product of industrial capitalism. Born from money and the operation of machines, it is nourished
                by human labor and ultimately blossoms. Unlike heavy metals, it is incredibly gentle. It flowers, bears
                fruit, and after the fruit decays and explodes, it returns once again to the dazzling money and roaring
                machines. It perishes, yet it will be reborn.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Try using the mouse to
                insert coins into the coin slot. After the machine operates, attempt to click on the center of each
                gear; something will appear. Try clicking with the mouse to encourage the Ferrabloom to blossom and bear
                fruit.
